# What do?
So like, why doesn't swtor have a "save password" checkbox.
Dumb.

This "fixes" that.

# How to
Download the bat file.

Change the "C:\PATH\TO\LAUNCHER.EXE" to wherever your swtor launcher lives.

Change the "YOURPASSWORD" to your password.

Run bat file as admin.

# Extra Credits
Create a shortcut to the bat file and you can make it run as admin every time.


>Right click -> Properties -> Advanced -> Run as admin
